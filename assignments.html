             <p>For this assignment I created my personal website where you can find my contact, projects, work experience and assignment repos. I used html for the coding of the different sites and then uploaded them to github and launched them.</p>
            <p> The above link is to a dumy assignment which is a python scipt adding two numbers. </p>

             <p>In this project, I analyzed elevator arrival data to determine the optimal position to wait in a lobby for the shortest walking distance to the next arriving elevator. By calculating average frequencies of elevator arrivals and testing different waiting locations, I developed a strategy that minimizes the average walking distance. Using both training and test datasets, I verified that the optimized location consistently outperformed the initial naive position, showing a measurable reduction in walking distance. </p>
