        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Paula. I have lived my whole life in Spain, in Madrid. I went to a british school and then adventured across the Atlantic for college.</p>
        <p>I'm currently a senior at BU studying cs and economics. I have taken most CS classes focused on anything programming including 111, 112, 210, 350, 411, and 410 which was the lowest level programming I've done. My specialty in economics is Econometrics and International Finance.</p>
